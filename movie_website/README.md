# Udacity Movie Website Project

This project is intended to display ability to write server-side code in Python. It shows some movie titles, posters, and trailers. I added some extras, like movie synopsis text on hover, and connection to The Movie Database API for titles, posters, and synopses. 

## How to run

Running this requires Python and the requests module (2.11.1).

To generate the static HTML movies page, run entertainment_center.py from the command line using Python. The resulting HTML page will open in a browser.
